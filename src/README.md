Chuck Norris Jokes App

I wrote this app using the React JS library for my graduation from Manchester Codes Software Engineering FastTrack course on Thursday 2nd July 2020.

Motivation

The app is designed to generate one-line jokes about the actor and untouchable martial arts God Chuck Norris. This is specifically for the use of software engineering students using the Pomodoro Technique or in need of regular breaks from their screens and studies. In the design, I have considered UX thoroughly, with a focus on accessibility. I chose a grey and orange colour scheme as this is known to present the fewest problems for users with colour blindness (8.5% of the UK population).  I chose a large, clean sans-serif font and ensured that all of the images include alt tags for blind or partially sighted users who may have screen readers.

Maintenance

I will continue to check the code and implement any updates on an ongoing basis. I will add any language and library deprecations as they occur.

Code Style

This app was written with html, css, js/jsx.

Installation

I have deployed this app using GitHub pages, it can be found live here: https://denisetench.github.io/chucknorrisjokes/

API Reference

The api I was requested to use to make this app is the Internet Chuck Norris Database: http://www.icndb.com/api/

I applied a filter to the URK to ensure that only jokes under the 'nerdy' category are included in the app (https://api.icndb.com/jokes/random?limitTo=[nerdy]. This also ensures that explicit content isn't shown to users.

Tests

All tests for this app are stored in the ___tests___ folder within my Github repository: https://github.com/DeniseTench/chucknorrisjokes

You can run these tests to ensure the code is firing correctly by navigating to the project folder using your terminal and executing 'npm t'.

Uses

This app is designed for use by anyone, but may be best for software students, adults, young adults and those of Chuck Norris appreciation age.
